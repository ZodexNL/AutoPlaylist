First we have to make sure we are logged into YouTube
Then we have to somehow grab our video's (maybe via playlist)(or via the songs that I liked on YouTube
The next step is to create a new playlist in spotify
And then we need to make sure that we search the song on Spotify
Lastly we need to add this song into our new Spotify playlist
